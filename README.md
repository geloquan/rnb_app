# 3D Facility Plotting System for Multi-Object Neighboring Structures in 

### <code style="color: red"> Status: Abandoned </code>

## Overview
#### This project was originally intended to implement 3D joined object systems. However, due to limited manpower and technical challenges associated with 3D integration, the project has been discontinued.

## Reason for Abandonment
#### During the development process, we realized that the intended business or facility environment does not currently require this system. Given these factors, resources were redirected to a continuation project better suited to the existing needs of the target environment.

## Next Steps
#### Although this project has been abandoned, a successor project has been initiated to address core functionality that aligns more closely with practical needs.
